## What is this game about?

This is an turn-based battler for 2 players. 
In the battler, players are able to test their tactical skills in 1v1 combat to determine who comes out on top.

Players can select from a set of classes, class specific moves, and stat-affecting equipment to create their own playstyle.

Players can then choose a stage with various environmental events that may affect the results of their attacks.
